# My Secondhand Bookstore

My Secondhand Book Store is an app that uses Wordpress/Woocommerce as client frontend/Backend.

The user enters Wordpress and can simply manage the Woocommerce Shop adding books, searching them on the Google Books Api and directly adding them with the cover, quantity avaible, price and book status. The stock can be managed updating/deleting the items directly from the app without needing the Woocommerce Product Managment.

Every add/update/delete made the app will be immediatly visible on the WooCommerce Shop for the customers.

### App's Cons

The app alows to easily build and shop using Wordpress/WooCommerce (frontend and backend) and manage the book insertions / storage through two simple pages.
